- **Assessment**: Optimal caching strategy

---

## 10. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Deployment)
1. None - all critical issues have been fixed

### Future Enhancements (Post-Deployment)
1. Consider adding coverage threshold enforcement (e.g., fail if < 60%)
2. Add coverage trends tracking (compare with previous runs)
3. Consider caching coverage data between runs
4. Add test performance metrics to PR comments
5. Consider adding coverage for MCP server tests
6. Add unit tests for manifest service

### Monitoring (Post-Deployment)
1. Watch first few workflow runs for any issues
2. Verify badge updates on main branch
3. Check PR comment formatting
4. Validate artifact uploads are accessible
