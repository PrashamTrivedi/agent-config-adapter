**Source**: [[/root/.claude/projects/-root-Code-agent-config-adapter/ee555795-e644-481c-b75b-7fb17d17cefd.jsonl]]
**Date**: 2026-01-10

## Accomplishments
Successfully migrated **16 task directories** to GitHub issues (Issues #60-#75).
- **12 Completed Tasks**: Migrated and closed.
- **4 Planned Tasks**: Migrated and left open for future work.

## Key Decisions
- Renamed processed directories with `[toDelete]` prefix to facilitate safe bulk deletion.
- Preserved strategic docs (`marketingNotes`) and interview notes (`jules-test`).
- Declined deletion of empty directories (`cld-test`, `walkthrough`) per user preference.

## Blockers
None encountered.
