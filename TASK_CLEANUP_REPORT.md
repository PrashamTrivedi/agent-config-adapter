**Accomplished**:
Completed a comprehensive audit of 20 task directories within `taskNotes/`. Categorized 12 as completed, 4 as planned/in-progress, and 4 as non-task or empty.

**Key Decisions**:
- Migrate 16 tasks to GitHub issues (closing 12 completed, keeping 4 open).
- Mark processed directories with `[toDelete]` for safe archiving.
- Delete empty directories `cld-test/` and `walkthrough/`.

**Blockers**:
Currently awaiting user confirmation to proceed with automated GitHub issue creation and cleanup.
